            <h2>Gap between earnings, expectations and economic reality narrows</h2>
            <p class="meta">
                <i class="fas fas-user"></i> Posted by <strong>Natalie Ashburn</strong> | August 12 2022
            </p>
            <img src="../imgs/image_resources/blog/blog2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There appears to be a gap between earnings expectations and economic reality. Investors’ concerns over
                record inflation levels earlier in 2022 have been compounded by supply problems and China’s Covid
                policies, as well as commodity prices driven by post-pandemic demand and the Ukraine war. To these fears
                are now added the risk of a recession as central banks try to slow economies with higher borrowing
                costs.</p>
            <p>Faced with four-decade high inflation, the Federal Reserve is increasing interest rates to slow demand
                and consumers are more pessimistic than at any time since 2014, according to recent polls. By one
                conventional measure, the American economy is already in recession: the country contracted for two
                consecutive quarters in the first half of 2022. Economic nervousness about how industrial and consumer
                demand will hold up is compounding geopolitical tensions, including the Ukraine war and its impacts on
                food supplies and energy markets, as well as Western tensions with China.</p>
            <p>Against this background, it is perhaps unsurprising that the S&P500 index has posted its worst first-six
                month performance in more than half a century, falling more than 13% year-to-date following a recovery
                since mid-June. Other US markets such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the technology-dominated
                Nasdaq have fallen between 10% and 20% respectively over the same period.</p>
            <p>This performance reflects the fears of investors faced with a catalogue of uncertainties rather than
                corporate results, which remain largely positive. Results have been supported by strong demand and – in
                some cases such as energy and select materials sectors – high commodity prices. With around 80% of the
                S&P500 already posting second-quarter results, nearly three-quarters of reporting companies have beaten
                earnings per share (EPS) growth estimates, although by narrower margins than during the first quarter.
                Earnings growth is around 10% higher than the second quarter of 2021 in the US, and more than 20% higher
                compared with a year earlier in European markets.</p>
            <h4>Still-positive forecasts</h4>
            <p>However, much of this is thanks to the energy sector. Excluding energy stocks, EPS growth in the US is
                negative over 12 months and just 6% higher in Europe. Looking ahead, EPS estimates for the rest of 2022
                and especially into 2023 have declined since the start of June. However, they remain higher than their
                levels at the beginning of 2022. Despite a widely anticipated US recession, forecasts still also point
                to positive EPS growth in 2023.</p>
            <p>How long will markets reflect economic fears rather than corporate realities? By looking at the time it
                has taken markets to reach a trough over the past six decades, we find that there were 15 periods in
                which the S&P500 fell more than 15%. Of these, eight were during recessions, with median declines from
                peak to trough that lasted 14 months and a 35% decline on average. Outside recessions, peak-to-trough
                was twice as fast, with a median drawdown of 19.4%.</p>
            <p>Earnings, which have already begun to adjust, therefore have some room to fall further. At the moment,
                corporate expectations appear consistent with a mild and manageable recession for most industries that
                are adapting to the current supply and cost challenges. Demand appears to remain resilient for now as
                households still have some savings after the pandemic, and many stresses are already factored into
                outlooks. Further, corporate margins still appear healthy with consensus forecasts pointing to
                improvements in 2023 as companies have so far managed to pass on their rising capital costs. That may
                change as higher labour costs begin to undermine corporate margins, but after an exceptionally difficult
                first half of 2022, investors are also becoming more confident in firms’ valuations and managements’
                outlooks.</p>
            <p>Of course, much of this is distorted by the energy crisis and may yet worsen. While many energy-intensive
                industries, such as automakers, have coped with increases to their energy production costs, the worst,
                including possible restrictions or rationing, may lie ahead as winter approaches in the northern
                hemisphere with low gas reserves and high oil prices.</p>
